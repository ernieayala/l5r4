/**
 * L5R4 Schema Migration Map - Field Remapping Rules for Data Structure Updates.
 * 
 * This module defines the mapping rules used by the migration system to update
 * document data structures when field names or locations change between system versions.
 * Each rule specifies how to move data from old field paths to new field paths.
 *
 * ## Migration Rule Structure:
 * Each rule is an object with the following properties:
 * - **docType**: Document type ("Actor" or "Item")
 * - **type**: Document subtype ("pc", "npc", "skill", etc.) or "*" for all types
 * - **from**: Source field path using dot-notation (e.g., "system.old_field")
 * - **to**: Target field path using dot-notation (e.g., "system.newField")
 *
 * ## Migration Categories:
 * - **Naming Convention Updates**: snake_case â†’ camelCase conversions
 * - **Field Relocations**: Moving fields to new parent objects
 * - **Structure Reorganization**: Flattening or nesting data structures
 * - **Legacy Cleanup**: Removing deprecated field names
 *
 * ## Safety Features:
 * - **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to run multiple times
 * - **Type-Specific Rules**: Apply only to matching document types
 * - **Universal Rules**: Use "*" type to apply to all subtypes
 * - **Non-Destructive**: Only migrates when source exists and target doesn't
 *
 * ## Usage Examples:
 * ```javascript
 * // Rename a field for all Actor types
 * { docType: "Actor", type: "*", from: "system.old_name", to: "system.newName" }
 * 
 * // Rename a field for specific Item type
 * { docType: "Item", type: "weapon", from: "system.damage_roll", to: "system.damageRoll" }
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link ./migrations.js} Migration system that processes these rules
