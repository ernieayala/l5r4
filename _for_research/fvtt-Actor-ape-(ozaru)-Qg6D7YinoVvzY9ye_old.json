They are common in the jungles of the Isles of Silk and Spice, and sometimes appear on the mainland as well, albeit much more rarely. Apes are not overtly aggressive, but they will defend any intrusion into their territory, and a perceived threat to their dominance will be met with brutal retaliation. Any warrior would consider it foolish to face an enraged ape without weapons.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The stats below represent a typical medium-sized ape.

For some, this results in a lifelong enjoyment of athletics. Like many who pursue a martial lifestyle, some bushi spend their off duty hours engaging in competitions with one another, or simply pitting themselves against challenges designed to test the limits of their physical abilities. Athletics covers many areas normally governed by Trait rolls. If you have a background in Athletics, however, you can perform these activities, principally climbing, running, and swimming, with considerably more ease than most. Athletics can also increase your capacity for movement, even when restricted by heavy armor and the like. The Throwing Emphasis allows you to throw items with greater accuracy, including certain weapons such as knives or even the wakizashi. Using Athletics to throw a weapon offensively is considered an attack roll. Athletics Skill Rolls to climb, run, or swim use Strength, whereas the Throwing Emphasis requires Agility.</p>",
